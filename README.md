# Git Over Here
A homework helper for GA IAs. Inspired by simon-script.

## How to Use!

Run ```node main.js | bash```.

Ask your students to post their full name as the title of the pull request. The first name will be split off and used as the name of their directory. (e.g. Soleil Solomon)

Follow the instructions and enter your organization's GitHub org (e.g. ```sei-nyc-jeopardy```).

Then enter the repo you'd like to pull form (e.g. ```js-data-types-homework```).

Finally, answer whether or not the project has dependencies to install with npm (e.g. no).

If you've already downloaded the pull once, run the program again and it will replace the old directory.
