# Git Over Here
A homework helper for GA IAs. Inspired by simon-script.

## How to Use!

Run ```npm start``` to run the program.

Ask your students to post their full name as the title of the pull request. The first name will be split off and used as the name of their directory. (e.g. Alex Trebek)

Follow the instructions and enter your organization's GitHub org (e.g. ```sei-nyc-jeopardy```).

Then enter the repo you'd like to pull form (e.g. ```js-data-types-homework```).

Finally, answer whether or not the project has dependencies to install with npm (e.g. no).

Pulling from the same repository twice will replace the old copy with the new open pulls.
